In dealing with noisy data, one sometimes wants to apply a filtering
operation.  The program @command{dsfilter} implements a simple
exponential low-pass filter with a given time-constant @var{tc}.  It is
assumed that the x-values are acquired at a constant sweep rate
@var{r}.  The x-array should be sorted in ascending order.  Usage:

@example
dsfilter -t @var{tc} -r @var{r} [-u|-d] ID(s)
@end example

Explanation of the options:

@table @code
@item -t @var{tc}
@itemx --T_c=@var{tc}
The time constant @var{tc} is assumed to be specified in seconds.
@item -r @var{r}
@itemx --rate=@var{r}
The sweep rate in x-units per hour.
@item -u
@itemx --up
The filter operation is performed from small x-values to large
x-values (the default).
@item -d
@itemx --down
Inverse to @code{-u}.
@end table

This operation is modeled after a typical situation in data
acquisition:  an x-parameter is varied slowly (on the scale of hours),
with the filter's time constant given in seconds.  To get rid of
these conversions, set @math{@var{r}=3600} and supply @var{tc} in
[x].
