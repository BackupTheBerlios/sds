With @command{dsfit}, you can fit a polynomial to your data.  On the
one hand, @command{dsfit} is @emph{the} prototype fit program, on the
other hand, some aspects are specific to fitting polynomials.  Most
prominently, there is no fixed set of fit parameters.  In principle,
you can use up to 26 parameters (@code{a}--@code{z}), corresponding to
a polynomal of 25th degree.  However, the program only considers the
parameters up to the highest degree specified by the user, expanding
the parameter set on demand (e.g. in interactive mode).

Apart from that, the usage of @command{dsfit} is rather
straightforward.  The general commands are as described in the
preceding sections.  The fit parameters are denoted by the lower-case
letters.  The fit function then is 
@tex
$$ a + b*x + c*x^2 + d*x^3 \ldots\,. $$ 
@end tex
@ifnottex
@math{a + b*x + c*x^2 + d*x^3 @enddots{}}
@end ifnottex
