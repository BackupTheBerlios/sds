Frequently, it is implicitly assumed that the x- and y-array of a
dataset describes a function @math{y(x)}.  This means that for each
x-value there is a unique y-value.  The command @command{dsfunc} makes
sure that this is the case:

@example
dsfunc ID(s)
@end example

@command{dsfunc} only checks whether adjacent elements of the x-array
are equal, so the datasets must be sorted.  If there are several
datapoints with the same x-value, they are replaced by a single point
the y-value of which is the average of those of the original
datapoints.  The physical size of the dataset is not reduced, since
this operation usually concerns only a small number of points.
