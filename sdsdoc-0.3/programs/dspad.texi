The program @command{dspad} increases the size of the given datasets
and fills the new part of the y-array with zeros.  As this is a common
operation in connection with the Fourier transform (@pxref{dsft}), the
default action is to resize the dataset to the nearest integer power
of 2.  Usage:

@example
dspad [-n @var{n}|-a @var{n}|-b @var{n}] ID(s)
@end example

The (mutually exclusive) options are:

@table @code
@item -n @var{n}
@itemx --number=@var{n}
Enlarge the dataset to @var{n} points.  @var{n} has to be larger than
the current length of the dataset. 
@item -a @var{n}
@itemx --add=@var{n}
Add @var{n} points to dataset.
@item -b=@var{n}
@itemx --log2=@var{n}
Enlarge the dataset to 
@ifnottex
@math{2^@var{n}} 
@end ifnottex
@tex
$2^n$ 
@end tex
points.
@end table

The new x-axis values are calculated by extrapolation, using
@math{x[0]} and @math{x[M-1]}, where @math{M} is the original number
of points.  Thus, the dataset should be ordered and the x-values
equally spaced.
