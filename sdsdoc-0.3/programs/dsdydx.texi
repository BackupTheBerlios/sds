The spline interpolation also offers a convenient way to compute the
derivatives of a dataset.  The program @command{dsdydx} is thus modeled
closely to @command{dsspline}.  For an extensive description,
@ref{dsspline}.  There is, naturally, one new command line option:

@table @code
@item -e=@var{n}
@itemx --derivative-order=@var{n}
Compute the @var{n}-th derivative 
@ifnottex
@math{d^n/dx^n y(x)}
@end ifnottex
@tex
${{{\rm d}^n}\over{{\rm d}x^n}} y(x)$
@end tex
.  The default is @math{@var{n}=1}.  In interactive mode, this
parameter can be referred to by: @code{e}, @code{derivative-order},
@code{der-order}, @code{derivative}, @code{der}, or @code{order}.
@end table

Apart from this, the usage is identical to that of
@command{dsspline}.  You can even use the @code{-r} option to
calculate the residuum, i.e. the difference between original data and
spline interpolation.  In this case, however, no derivative is
produced!

Two new qpl windows are started in interactive mode:  one showing the
original data and its spline-interpolation (as with
@command{dsspline}), the other displaying the derivative (on plotlevel
97).
