The program @command{qpl} uses the Qt graphics library to show a
graphical representation of the datasets in an X window.  The central
data segment is checked in regular intervals, to update the plot if
necessary.  Via menues or short-keys, the properties of the display,
like the viewport, the scaling of the axis, or the plotlevels shown,
can be modified.  The program also offers an interface to
@command{pspl} for creating plots.  Usage:

@example
qpl [-u @var{time}] [-i @var{n} -a @var{n} | -l @var{n}]
@end example

The command line options are: 
@table @code
@item -u @var{time}
@itemx --updatetime=@var{time}
Refresh the plot every @var{time} milliseconds.  The default value is
333 ms.
@item -i @var{n}
@itemx --minlevel=@var{n}
Show only those datasets with a plotlevel of at least @var{n}.  The
default is 0.
@item -a @var{n}
@itemx --maxlevel=@var{n}
Show datasets with a plotlevel of up to @var{n}.  The default is 100.
@item -l @var{n}
@itemx --level=@var{n}
Show only the datasets with plotlevel @var{n}. 
@end table

This documentation will refrain from listing all the available user
actions. 

@command{qpl}'s x- and y-axis can be switched to a logarithmic scale
only if the data shown is strictly positive.
