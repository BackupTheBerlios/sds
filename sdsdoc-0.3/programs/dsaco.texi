The autocorrelation function is defined as the convolution of a
function with a shifted copy of itself:
@ifnottex
@display
@math{ACO(x) = integral( f(x')*f(x'+x), x' )}.
@end display
@end ifnottex
@tex
$${\rm ACO}(x)=\int_{-\infty}^{+\infty}{\rm d}x'\,f(x')\cdot{}f(x'+x)\,.$$
@end tex
A convenient way to compute the convolution is via the Fourier
transformation -- the FT of the autocorrelation is the power spectral
density.

Therefore, the command @command{dsaco} is closely related to
@command{dsft}, and much of the same rules apply, @ref{dsft}. 
Its usage is very simple in comparison:

@example 
dsaco [-a] ID(s)
@end example

If the @code{-a} option (long version @code{--anti}) is given, the
anti-autocorrelation function is calculated.  This is a variant of the
convolution defined above, with @math{f(x')} substituted by
@math{f(-x')}.
