If you have two datasets with the same x-arrays, you might want to
display the two like in the X-Y mode of an oscilloscope (where the
common x-axis is the time).  That is, you want each datapoint to
contain the two corresponding y-values.  @command{dsxy} does exactly
this: 

@example
dsxy [-r|-R] IDs
@end example

There must be an even number of IDs, each pair of datasets has to 
share their x-values.  The y-array of the first ID will be the new
x-array.  The (mutually exclusive) options are:

@table @code
@item -r
@itemx --replace_x
The resulting dataset replaces the first dataset of the original pair.
@item -R
@itemx --replace_y
The resulting dataset replaces the second dataset of the original pair.
@end table

If no option is specified, a new dataset is created.
